## Installation

1. Running `git clone https://github.com/DaoThinh96/appium`
2. Running `npm install`
3. Installing Appium on a local machine [here](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/)
4. Setting up Android and iOS on a local machine [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28234268/how-to-setup-a-platform-to-develop-ios-apps-with-windows-and-java-knowledge)
5. Making demo app available. Create a `./apps` directory. Download the app files (.app / .apk) with version >= `0.4.0` [here](https://github.com/webdriverio/native-demo-app/6eleases). Move the files into the directory `apps`.
6. `appium driver install xcuitest` to install iOS driver.
7. Running tests `npm run ios.app` or `npm run ios.browser` for iOS. `npm run android.app` or `npm run android.browser` for Android.

## Configuration files

This repository uses a specific config for iOS and Android, see [configs](./config). The configs are based on a shared config
[`wdio.shared.conf.ts`](./config/wdio.shared.conf.ts).
This shared config holds **all the defaults** so the iOS and Android configs only need to hold the capabilities and specs that are needed
for running on iOS and or Android (app or browser).

Please check the [`wdio.shared.conf.ts`](./config/wdio.shared.conf.ts)-file for the minimal configuration options. Notes are added for why
a different value has been selected in comparison to the default values WebdriverIO provides.

Since we do not have Appium installed as part of this package we are going to use the globally installed version of Appium. This is
configured in [`wdio.shared.local.appium.conf.ts`](./config/wdio.shared.local.appium.conf.ts).

## Locator strategy for native apps

The locator strategy for this code is to use `accessibilityID`'s, see also the
[WebdriverIO docs](https://webdriver.io/docs/selectors#accessibility-id) or this newsletter on
[AppiumPro](https://appiumpro.com/editions/20).
`accessibilityID`'s make it easy to script once and run on iOS and Android because most of the apps already have some `accessibilityID`'s.

If `accessibilityID`'s can't be used, and for example only XPATH is available, then the following setup could be used to make cross-platform
selectors

```js
const SELECTORS = {
    WEB_VIEW_SCREEN: browser.isAndroid
        ? "*//android.webkit.WebView"
        : "*//XCUIElementTypeWebView",
};
```

## Native App Tests

All tests can be executed on te devices as configured in [`wdio.android.app.conf.ts`](./config/wdio.android.app.conf.ts) or
[`wdio.ios.app.conf.ts`](./config/wdio.ios.app.conf.ts). Please check the below tests on what they do or on how to run them separately.

```sh
# For Android local execution
npm run android.app

# For iOS local execution
npm run ios.app
```
